The grantee shall produce 3 pieces of short (<2 minutes) video content, which we will use for social media. A piece will be considered complete when it is posted publicly. The reward for completing 3 pieces is 1 star. This will be done on an as-needed basis, so there is no specfic timeline for this grant.
